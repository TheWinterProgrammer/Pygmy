# Pygmy CMS 🪆

A self-hosted CMS and website builder with a dark glass design system.

## Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|-------|------|
| **Backend** | Node.js + Express + SQLite (better-sqlite3) |
| **Admin Panel** | Vue 3 + Vite + TipTap rich editor |
| **Public Frontend** | Vue 3 + Vite + Pinia |

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install all deps
cd backend   && npm install
cd ../admin  && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install

# 2. Seed the default admin user
cd backend && npm run seed
# → admin@pygmy.local / pygmy123 (change immediately in Settings)

# 3. Run all three in separate terminals
cd backend   && npm run dev   # → http://localhost:3200
cd admin     && npm run dev   # → http://localhost:5173
cd frontend  && npm run dev   # → http://localhost:5174
```

### Phase 19 — Product Reviews + Shipping at Checkout + Order Lookup ✅
- **Product Reviews on public frontend** — `ProductView` shows star-rating aggregate (avg score + 5-bar histogram by star count), a scrollable review list (author, date, star row, title, body), and a full "Write a Review" form with interactive star picker, name/email/title/body fields, and a post-submission confirmation; calls `GET /api/reviews?product_id=` for approved reviews with stats, and `POST /api/reviews` to submit (held pending until admin approves); review list and form loaded alongside product data on route mount
- **Shipping calculator at checkout** — `CheckoutView` now features a country dropdown (40 countries alphabetically sorted), fires `POST /api/shipping/calculate` when a country is chosen, and renders the returned zone rates as radio buttons (name + cost; threshold/free rates are resolved server-side); the selected rate's cost is added to `orderTotal`; if only one rate exists it is auto-selected; if no rates exist for the country a "contact us" notice is shown; `shipping_country`, `shipping_rate_name`, and `shipping_cost` are all included in the order payload; backend `orders.js` and `db.js` updated to accept + store the two new columns
- **Order Lookup page (`/order/lookup`)** — new public page with a glass card form (order number + email); calls `POST /api/orders/lookup` and displays a full order summary: status pill (color-coded per status), customer name, shipping address, order date, items table with thumbnail/qty/line-total, subtotal, discount, shipping cost, and grand total; "Track another order" button to reset; link added to `OrderConfirmView` CTAs and `SiteFooter` quick-links column
- **Admin Orders modal** — shipping country, rate name, and cost now displayed in the order detail panel (shows "Free" when cost = 0 and a country was selected)
- **Admin ShippingView bugfix** — removed broken `useSiteStore` import (admin panel has no site store); currency symbol is now loaded lazily via `GET /api/settings` on mount

### Phase 18 — E-Commerce Settings + Orders CSV Export + Inventory API ✅
- **E-Commerce settings section in admin Settings** — new 🛒 E-Commerce section with: currency code + symbol (used across checkout, order confirmation, admin panels), checkout intro text (displayed at top of `/checkout`), thank-you message (shown on order confirmation page), order confirmation email subject (`#{order_number}` placeholder), order status update email subject, and toggle checkboxes for "email admin on new order" and "email customer on status change"; all settings persisted via existing `PUT /api/settings` batch endpoint
- **Orders CSV export** — `GET /api/orders/export/csv` endpoint (admin, JWT-authenticated); supports `?status=`, `?from=` and `?to=` date filters; generates a properly escaped CSV with columns: order_number, status, customer_name, customer_email, customer_phone, shipping_address, subtotal, discount_amount, coupon_code, total, notes, created_at; admin Orders panel header gets an ⬇️ Export CSV button (respects current status filter, blob-downloads via fetch with auth header)
- **Inventory API** — `GET /api/products/inventory` endpoint (admin); returns `{ items, outOfStock, lowStock, healthy }` arrays for all products with `track_stock = 1`; items sorted by stock ascending; outOfStock = stock ≤ 0 + backorders disallowed; lowStock = stock within threshold; useful for integrations, webhooks, external inventory tooling
- **Backup enhancements** — `orders` and `coupons` tables now included in the full JSON backup export; stats endpoint now returns `orders` and `coupons` counts; BackupView labels updated to display all content types including events, orders, and coupons

- **`@vueuse/head` bootstrap fix** — `createHead()` now properly installed in `frontend/src/main.js` so all `useHead()` composable calls (ProductView, EventView, EventsView) correctly update `<head>` meta tags; EventsView + EventView migrated from invalid template `<useHead>` component syntax to the composable API

### Phase 14 — Two-Factor Authentication + Notification Center + Bulk Operations ✅
- **Two-Factor Authentication (TOTP)** — `speakeasy` + `qrcode` libraries added; `totp_secret` + `totp_enabled` columns on `users` table; full API: `GET /api/auth/2fa/setup` generates a secret + QR code data URL, `POST /api/auth/2fa/enable` verifies the OTP and activates 2FA, `POST /api/auth/2fa/disable` deactivates (accepts current OTP or account password); login flow updated: if `totp_enabled` the backend returns HTTP 206 `{ requires_2fa: true }` after correct credentials; LoginView presents a second step with a large OTP input field and a back button; `SettingsView` → 🔑 Two-Factor Authentication section with QR code display + verification field + activate/disable flow; auth store `login()` accepts optional `otp` param
