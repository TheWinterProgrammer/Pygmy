# Pygmy CMS 🪆

A self-hosted CMS and website builder with a dark glass design system.

## Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|-------|------|
| **Backend** | Node.js + Express + SQLite (better-sqlite3) |
| **Admin Panel** | Vue 3 + Vite + TipTap rich editor |
| **Public Frontend** | Vue 3 + Vite + Pinia |

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install all deps
cd backend   && npm install
cd ../admin  && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install

# 2. Seed the default admin user
cd backend && npm run seed
# → admin@pygmy.local / pygmy123 (change immediately in Settings)

# 3. Run all three in separate terminals
cd backend   && npm run dev   # → http://localhost:3200
cd admin     && npm run dev   # → http://localhost:5173
cd frontend  && npm run dev   # → http://localhost:5174
```

## Features

### Phase 1 — Backend ✅
- SQLite schema: users, pages, posts, categories, media, navigation, settings
- REST API with JWT/bcrypt auth
- Media upload with multer

### Phase 2 — Admin Panel ✅
- Login screen (glass card)
- Dashboard (stats: pages, posts, media, nav items)
- Pages CRUD with TipTap rich editor + SEO fields
- Posts CRUD with categories, tags, cover image, publish toggle
- Media library (grid view + upload)
- Navigation builder (drag/reorder)
- Settings (site name, tagline, hero content, accent color, footer)

### Phase 3 — Public Frontend ✅
- Floating glass navbar with dropdown support + mobile hamburger
- Hero section (fullscreen, optional bg image, headline/subtitle from CMS)
- Blog listing with category filters, tag filters, pagination
- Post detail with cover image, tags, SEO meta + OG tags
- Dynamic CMS page renderer
- Loading skeletons + 404 states

### Phase 9 — Newsletter Subscribers + Content Backup/Export ✅
- **Newsletter subscriber system** — `subscribers` + `newsletter_campaigns` SQLite tables; public `POST /api/newsletter/subscribe` (with re-subscribe support); public `GET /api/newsletter/unsubscribe?token=` (branded HTML page); admin CRUD: list/filter/status-toggle/delete subscribers; `POST /api/newsletter/send` sends HTML email to all active subscribers using nodemailer (unsubscribe link auto-appended); campaign history stored and viewable; `NewsletterView` admin panel with compose modal + campaigns tab + CSV export
- **Newsletter frontend widget** — `NewsletterForm.vue` component shown in `SiteFooter.vue` when `newsletter_enabled = 1`; Settings → Newsletter section: enable/disable toggle + intro text customisation + link to subscriber management
- **Dashboard** — new Subscribers stat card with active count; quick-action buttons for Newsletter and Backup
- **Full backup/export** — `GET /api/backup/export` → full JSON snapshot of all content (pages, posts, categories, products, navigation, subscribers, redirects, settings) with site name + export date in filename; `GET /api/backup/export/csv?type=posts|pages|products|subscribers` → typed CSV exports; `BackupView` admin panel with content summary stats, one-click JSON download, four CSV export cards, and best-practice notes; 🗄️ Backup sidebar entry added
- **better-sqlite3 rebuilt** for Node v25.8.0 (prebuilt binary now resolves correctly)

### Phase 8 — Activity Logging + Image Optimization + Redirect Manager ✅
- **Comprehensive activity logging** — `logActivity` wired into all mutation routes: pages (create/update/delete), posts (update/delete; create already existed), products (create/update/delete), media (upload/delete), comments (status change/delete), users (create/update/delete), redirects (create/update/delete); all admin actions now appear in Dashboard → Recent Activity feed
- **Image auto-optimization** — media upload now auto-converts JPEG/PNG images above 200 KB to WebP (max 1920px, 85% quality) using the already-installed `sharp`; file size significantly reduced; original swapped for `.webp` version transparently; SVG and GIF files are left untouched
- **Redirect Manager** — full 301/302 redirect system: new `redirects` SQLite table; REST API at `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/redirects`; Express middleware catches non-API paths on the backend; Vue frontend router guard checks `GET /api/redirects/check?path=` on every navigation and performs client-side redirect (supports both internal paths and external URLs); admin `RedirectsView` with add/edit/delete modals, type badges, creation date; sidebar entry 🔀 Redirects added
- **Dashboard** — new Redirects stat card; quick-action button to `/redirects`

### Phase 7 — Multi-user Management + Contact Forms ✅
- **Multi-user management** — full CRUD for user accounts at `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/users` (admin-only); new `adminOnly` middleware; roles: `admin` (full access) vs `editor` (content only); can't delete yourself or change your own role; `UsersView` in admin with invite/edit/delete modals + role badges
- **Contact form** — public `POST /api/contact` endpoint stores name, email, subject, message, IP + timestamps in new `form_submissions` SQLite table; admin `ContactView` with status cycling (unread → read → archived), detail modal with reply-via-email link, delete confirm; unread badge count in sidebar; `GET /api/contact/stats` for dashboard
- **Public /contact page** — glass-card form with client-side validation, required fields, success state, `contact_intro` customisable from Settings → Contact Page section
- **Dashboard** — two new stat cards: Contact messages (unread badge alert) and Users count
- **Bug fix** — installed missing `@vueuse/head` dep that broke frontend `vite build`

### Phase 6 — Product Catalog ✅
- **SQLite-backed products** — `products` + `product_categories` tables; full CRUD REST API (`/api/products`)
- **Rich product fields** — name, slug, excerpt, TipTap description, price, sale price, SKU, cover image, gallery (multi-image), category, tags, status draft/published, featured flag, SEO meta
- **Admin panel** — `ProductsView` (sortable grid with thumbnails, price, status, featured star) + `ProductEditView` (two-column editor with MediaPickerModal for cover + multi-gallery, inline category creation, all fields)
- **Dashboard stat** — product count + published count card added to Dashboard
- **Public frontend** — `/shop` listing with category filter buttons + tag filter badges + pagination + sale/featured badges; `/shop/:slug` detail page with main image, gallery thumbnails, sale discount %, rich description prose
- **Search** — products included in `/api/search` results; SearchView shows a Products section
- **Sitemap** — `/shop` + all published `/shop/:slug` URLs included in `sitemap.xml`

### Phase 5 — Comments & Search ✅
- **Comments system** — readers submit comments (name, email, content) → held as `pending`; admins approve/spam/delete from new 💬 Comments view in admin panel; approved comments rendered below each post
- **Full-text search** — `GET /api/search?q=` searches published posts + pages (title, excerpt, content) with title-match priority; `/search` page in frontend with debounced input, result grid (posts + pages), keyword highlight; search icon in floating nav
- **Dashboard comment stats** — total + pending count in Dashboard stat card with badge alert

### Phase 4 — Polish & SEO ✅
- **`/sitemap.xml`** — auto-generated XML sitemap of all published pages + posts
- **`/feed.xml`** — RSS 2.0 feed of the latest 20 published posts
- **MediaPickerModal** — inline media library picker in PostEditView cover image field + Settings logo/hero bg fields (browse + search + double-click to insert)
- **User Profile** — change display name, email, and password from Settings panel (`PUT /api/auth/me`)

## Design System (Lunexo-inspired dark glass)

```css
--bg:      hsl(228, 4%, 10%)   /* page background */
--surface: hsl(228, 4%, 15%)   /* cards/panels */
--accent:  hsl(355, 70%, 58%)  /* red highlight (overridable per-site) */
/* Glass: backdrop-filter:blur(16px) + rgba(255,255,255,0.1) border */
